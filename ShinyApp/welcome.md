This Shiny App is part of the project for the Coursera Developing Data Products course from John Hopkins University.

The App uses the Titanic dataset which includes various attributes for the passengers on this ill-fated voyage including whether a person survived or not. 

The App can be used to explore the data or to predict the probability of survival given some parameters.
